      <google-codelab-step label="Introduction" duration="10">
        <p><strong>Welcome, student!</strong></p>
<p>This codelab is intended to teach you about the SMART launch API, CDS Hooks, and SMART Web Messaging by walking you through a coding exercise that uses those technologies.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Profile Audience</h3>
<p>This guide is intended for programmers who wish to learn by doing.  You should already have a working knowledge of web app programing, access to a development machine, and about 2 to 4 total hours to dedicate to completing the whole codelab.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This guide assumes you are already familiar with javascript and are comfortable with web programming concepts.  It also helps to understand the basics of <code>git</code>, but there will be example commands throughout to help you if you are new.  The provided codebase uses <code>javascript</code>, <code>node</code>, <code>npn</code>, and <code>express</code> - so some prior experience with those tools will be helpful, but is not required.  You are also free to re-write whole portions of the code in whatever framework you like (and please feel free to share your work with us)!</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Major Milestones</h3>
<p>You will start with an already-implemented form-entry app that evaluates the appropriateness of a potential advanced imaging order and displays a rating of either <code>appropriate</code>, <code>not-appropriate</code>, or <code>no-guidelines-apply</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>v1: Make the app SMART-launch capable, enabling an EHR to launch it.</li>
<li>v2: Create a CDS hook service to evaluate a <em>draft</em> order in an EHR, and show a link to the SMART app.</li>
<li>v3: Enable the SMART app to update the draft order inside the EHR.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>&#34;If we in the United States could lower the prices and per-capita volumes of our CT scans, MRIs, and just the top 25 high-volume-high-price surgical procedures to those of the Netherlands, for example, we would see savings of about $425 per capita, or a total of $137 billion.&#34;</em></p>

<h3 is-upgraded>Note</h3>
<p>This section has <em>lots</em> of background which explains <em>why</em> the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ClinicalLabFeeSched/PAMA-Regulations" target="_blank">PAMA</a> imaging use case was chosen for this exercise.  If you aren&#39;t interested in PAMA, and are here purely to learn the technology, you can skip ahead to the next section.  However, it might help to take at least <em>a few</em> minutes to skim this material, just to get the gist of what problem is being solved.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><em>Warp</em> Ahead</h3>
<p>If you already have a good grasp of the SMART launch process, and you would like to do a lot more than <em>skip</em> ahead, you can <strong>warp</strong> ahead and begin the process at CDS hook implementation by checking out the code at <code>v2.0</code> in the repo and jump to <a href="Write A CDS Hook" target="_blank">section v2</a>.<br>TODO: get the section link working for the [section 2] link above.</p>
<p>There&#39;s even an analogous git tag which will give you the <strong>final</strong> solution at <code>v3.0</code>.  This is fine if you just want to quickly have a working copy of the app to play with, but if you&#39;re here to learn - I recommend finding time to do the full codelab.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>PAMA</h2>
<p>New PAMA imaging requirements are taking effect, starting on January 1st, 2020.  The American College of Radiology has put out some very helpful media to explain why this is important, which I recommend checking out for a few minutes.</p>

<h3 is-upgraded>PAMA Timeline</h3>
<h4 is-upgraded>2020</h4>
<p>Starting in 2020, providers in the US who order diagnostic advanced imaging (CT, MRI, nuclear medicine, and PET scans) will need to provide <em>evidence</em> that they have consulted <em>best practice guidelines</em> for appropriate use of that technology <em>while they are still at the point of order entry</em>.</p>
<h4 is-upgraded>2021</h4>
<p>Failure to submit a claim for imaging that has this evidence, starting in 2021, may <em>prevent</em> reimbursement (for Medicare part B claims) for furnishing providers (who are typically radiologists).</p>
<h4 is-upgraded>2022</h4>
<p>Ordering providers who have a <em>consistently</em> poor history of ordering &#34;low value&#34; diagnosic imaging may then be subject to mandatory prior authorization before placing image orders for Medicare patients starting in 2022.  Some of those rules are TBD, depending on how the first two years go, though.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Apropriate Use Criteria (AUC)</h3>
<p>In short, for software to determine whether an imaging technique is <em>apropriate</em> or not for a given diagnosis, several groups of specialists have been developing <em>apropriate use criteria</em> and publishing that criteria for the industry to adopt into the EHR workflow.  These AUC are regularly improved, updated, and re-published.</p>
<p>TODO: inline-link to AUC above</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Qualified CDS Mechanisms (QCDSM)</h3>
<p>The software providers who use this criteria, the QCDSM vendors, must provide access to best practice guidelines for a wide spectrum of medical care areas.  For PAMA imaging, we are interested in the radiology imaging AUC and we have prepared a simple example of QCDSM guideline consultation software.  However, a QCDSM must use more than one published set of AUC in their software, and have a method of updating their AUC periodically.  As such, the software can be quite complex, and is often implemented as a stand-alone web service.</p>
<p>TODO: inline-link to the list of QCDSMs</p>
<h2 class="faq" is-upgraded>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded>Quesion</h3>
<p>Why are CDS Hooks important for PAMA?</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Answer</h3>
<p>To satisfy radiologist claims to CMS, the original order must include evidence that guidelines were consulted at the point of order entry.  This means, while the provider is still using the EHR, they must also be consulting a guideline app.  By using CDS Hooks, we can provide a link to the app as soon as it&#39;s relevant to them (like when they&#39;re placing an order for advanced imaging).</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Question</h3>
<p>Why is SMART Web Messaging important for PAMA?</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Answer</h3>
<p>Because the logic to determine when a service is or isn&#39;t appropriate is complex, these are often implemented in stand-alone web-based applications.  To enable those applications to <strong>update</strong> the currently draft order, we need SMART Web Messaging.  With SMART Web Messagine we can send data and actions back into the EHR, securely and easily.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Exercise Outline" duration="5">
        <p>You are provided with a very simple, but working, guideline consultation app.  In PAMA parlance, this would be software from a Qualified CDS Mechanism, or a QCDSM.</p>
<p>TODO: insert a screenshot of the starting app.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>SMART Launch</h2>
<p>You will add SMART launch capabilities to the app, allowing it to be launched by the EHR and to receive EHR data directly through the SMART launch client.</p>
<p>TODO: insert a screenshot of the app, pre-populated with patient demographic data.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>CDS Hooks</h2>
<p>Once the app is capable of a SMART launch, you will write a CDS Hook service to alert ordering providers when they have made an order selection that is outside of guidelines.  The alert will give them a helpful link to click on, which will launch the app <em>within the EHR</em>.  The app will read context from the EHR and use that to pre-populate the appropriate fields in its form, saving the clinician time and mental effort.</p>
<p>TODO: insert some images of the cards</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>SMART Web Messaging</h2>
<p>Finally, a new button will be added in the app that will be able to update the draft order items with the current selection.  Upon update, evidence of guideline consultation will be attached to the order, before closing the app, returning the user to the order entry screen in the EHR.</p>
<p>TODO: insert an image of the embedded app.</p>
<h2 class="faq" is-upgraded>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>QUESTION: Which EHRs currently support the technologies required to enable these services?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Currently, Epic and T-System have implemented the required CDS hooks to enable this.  Cerner has committed to doing this, though, and it&#39;s not a matter of if, but of when.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Enable SMART launch" duration="60">
        <p>With the SMART launch API, the app will be able to securely read data from the EHR using the credentials of the clinician.  The provider will not need to remember a separate username and password to use the app anymore, and the app will be able to pre-load form fields using the available context in the EHR.</p>
<p>This will reduce user errors, save the user time, and spare them some frustrations.</p>

The UI could give the user an option to request a refresh before it expires, or at least indicate in the UI when the token has expired (with a message like &#34;EHR token has expired - please reload&#34;).</p>
