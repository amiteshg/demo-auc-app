        <h2 is-upgraded>Welcome, student!</h2>
<p>This codelab is intended to teach you about the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/" target="_blank">SMART launch framework</a>, <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/" target="_blank">CDS Hooks</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-web-messaging" target="_blank">SMART Web Messaging</a> by walking you through a coding exercise that uses those technologies.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Profile Audience</h3>
<p>This guide is intended for programmers who wish to <em>learn by doing</em>.  You should already have a working knowledge of web programing, access to a development machine, and about 2 to 4 total hours to dedicate to completing the whole codelab.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This guide assumes you are already familiar with javascript and are comfortable with web programming concepts.  It also helps to know the basics of <code>git</code>, but there will be example commands throughout for convenience.  The provided initial codebase uses <code>javascript</code>, <code>node</code>, <code>npn</code>, and <code>express</code> - so some prior experience with those tools will be helpful, but not required.</p>
<p>As always, you are free to re-write entire portions of the code in whatever framework you like (but please feel free to share your work with us)!</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Major Milestones</h3>
<p>You will start with an already-implemented form-entry app that evaluates the appropriateness of a potential advanced imaging order and displays a rating of either <code>appropriate</code>, <code>not-appropriate</code>, or <code>no-guidelines-apply</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>v1: Make the app SMART-launch capable, enabling an EHR to launch it.</li>
<li>v2: Create a CDS hook service to evaluate a <em>draft</em> order in an EHR, and show a link to the SMART app.</li>
<li>v3: Enable the SMART app to update the draft order inside the EHR.</li>
</ul>

<h3 is-upgraded>Skip Ahead</h3>
<p>This section has <em>lots</em> of background which explains <em>why</em> the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ClinicalLabFeeSched/PAMA-Regulations" target="_blank">PAMA</a> imaging use case was chosen for this exercise.  If you aren&#39;t interested in PAMA, and are here purely to learn the technology, you can skip ahead to the next section.  However, it might help to take at least <em>a few</em> minutes to skim this material, just to get the gist of what problem is being solved.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded><strong>Warp</strong> Ahead</h3>
<p>If you already have a good grasp of the SMART launch process, and you would like to do a lot more than <em>skip</em> ahead, you can <strong>warp</strong> ahead and begin the process at CDS hook implementation by checking out the code at <code>v2.0</code> in the repo and advancing to the section called <strong>Write a CDS hook</strong> in this codelab.</p>
<p>There&#39;s another git tag, <code>v3.0</code>, for the <strong>final</strong> solution.  Check out this version of the code if you just want to play with a working copy of the app.  However, if you&#39;re here to learn, it is recommended that you find time to do the full codelab.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>PAMA Imaging</h2>
<p>New PAMA imaging requirements are taking effect, starting on January 1st, 2020.  The American College of Radiology has put out some very helpful media to explain why this is important.</p>

<h3 is-upgraded>Apropriate Use Criteria (AUC)</h3>
<p>In short, for software to determine whether an imaging technique is <em>apropriate</em> or not for a given diagnosis, several groups of specialists have been developing <em>apropriate use criteria</em> and publishing that criteria for the industry to adopt into the EHR workflow.  These AUC are regularly improved, updated, and re-published.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Provider Led Entities (PLE)</h3>
<p>The groups of experts and specialists who decide what is and isn&#39;t appropriate are called <em>Provider Led Entities</em>.  They develop the AUC out in the open and publish it reqularly for consumption by software vendors who provide CDS.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Qualified CDS Mechanisms (QCDSM)</h3>
<p>The software providers who use this criteria, the QCDSM vendors, must provide access to best practice guidelines for a wide spectrum of medical care areas.  For PAMA imaging, we are interested in the radiology imaging AUC and we have prepared a simple example of QCDSM guideline consultation software.  However, a QCDSM must use more than one published set of AUC in their software, and have a method of updating their AUC periodically.  As such, the software can be quite complex, and is often implemented as a stand-alone web service.</p>
<h2 class="faq" is-upgraded>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded>Why are <em>CDS Hooks</em> important for PAMA?</h3>
<aside class="special"><p>To satisfy a radiologist&#39;s claim to CMS, the original order must include evidence that guidelines were consulted at the point of order entry (by the <em>ordering provider</em>).  This means that, while the ordering provider is still using the EHR, they must also be consulting a guideline app.  By using <em>CDS Hooks</em>, the EHR can provide a link to the guideline app as soon as it&#39;s relevant (like when selecting an order for advanced imaging, before signing the order).<br></p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded>Why is <em>SMART Web Messaging</em> important for PAMA?</h3>
<aside class="special"><p>Because the logic to determine <em>when</em> a service is or isn&#39;t appropriate can be very complex, this logic is often implemented in stand-alone web-based applications.  To enable those applications to <strong>update</strong> the currently <em>draft</em> order, we need SMART Web Messaging.  With SMART Web Messaging, we can easily and securely send data and actions <em>back</em> into the EHR.</p>

      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Exercise Outline" duration="5">
        <p>You are provided with a very simple, but working, guideline consultation app.  In PAMA parlance, this would be software from a Qualified CDS Mechanism, or a QCDSM.</p>
<iframe class="embedded-iframe" src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/jewel-chevre?path=package.json&previewSize=100"></iframe>
<h2 is-upgraded>SMART Launch</h2>
<p>You will add SMART launch capabilities to the app, allowing it to be launched by the EHR and to receive EHR data directly through the SMART launch client.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: if possible, host the working v2 code on glitch and embed a link to it here.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>CDS Hooks</h2>
<p>Once the app is capable of a SMART launch, you will write a CDS Hook service to alert ordering providers when they have made an order selection that is outside of guidelines.  The alert will give them a helpful link to click on, which will launch the app <em>within the EHR</em>.  The app will read context from the EHR and use that to pre-populate the appropriate fields in its form, saving the clinician time and mental effort.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: insert some images of the cards</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>SMART Web Messaging</h2>
<p>Finally, a new button will be added in the app that will be able to update the draft order items with the current selection.  Upon update, evidence of guideline consultation will be attached to the order, before closing the app, returning the user to the order entry screen in the EHR.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: insert an image of the embedded app.</p>
<h2 class="faq" is-upgraded>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded>Which EHRs currently support the technologies required to enable these services?</h3>
<aside class="special"><p>Currently, Epic and T-System have implemented the required CDS hooks to enable this.  Cerner has committed to doing this, though, and it&#39;s not a matter of if, but of when.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Enable SMART launch" duration="60">
        <p>With the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/" target="_blank">SMART App Launch Framework</a>, the app will be able to securely read data from the EHR using the credentials of the clinician (through OAuth2 openid connect).  The provider will not need to remember a separate username and password to use the app anymore, and the app will be able to pre-load form fields using the available context in the EHR.</p>
<p>This will reduce user errors, save the user time, and spare them some frustrations.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>SMART Launch Documentation</h2>
<p>There is a very handy javascript library to enable easy configuration of SMART launches from the app.<br><a href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/" target="_blank">http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/</a></p>
<h3 is-upgraded>EXERCISE 1</h3>
<aside class="special"><p>Consult the link above, and create a <code>launch.html</code> endpoint.</p>
</aside>
<p>Confused?  Part of the goal of this codelab is to get you familiar with using the documentation, so there will be minimal hand-holding throughout.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of hints, in case this seems like a vague request.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may need to use the <code>npm</code> command to install the library.</li>
<li>Once installed, you will want to create an endpoint ‘page&#39; for use in a browser using the ‘As Library&#39; approach, rather than the ‘As Module&#39; approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO: reveal a solution <code>launch.html</code> endpoint and confirm that student solution is correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the scopes correct?</li>
<li>What is the value of the client_id (AND WHAT SHOULD IT BE???)</li>

<h2 is-upgraded>The SMART App Launcher</h2>
<p>To test the new launch endpoint, we can use a free, open source tool called the SMART App Launcher.<br><a href="http://launch.smarthealthit.org/" target="_blank">http://launch.smarthealthit.org/</a></p>
<p>EXERCISE: Visit the site and enter the path to your <code>launch.html</code> endpoint.  Click the green Launch App button to test.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Troubleshooting &amp; Caveats</h3>
<p>PROBLEM: I only see a white screen.</p>
<p>ANSWER: You may have entered an <code>https</code>, rather than an <code>http</code>, endpoint url.  Try changing it to <code>http</code>.</p>

<h3 is-upgraded><code>codelab markdown</code></h3>
<pre><code>&lt;dt&gt;positive&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a positive infobox.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2 is-upgraded>Surveys</h2>
<p>You can include a survey in the codelab which will create Google Analytics variables, which will collect survey response totals.</p>
<google-codelab-survey survey-id="docs-1">
<h4></h4>
<paper-radio-group>
<paper-radio-button>Example item 1</paper-radio-button>
<paper-radio-button>Example item 2</paper-radio-button>
</paper-radio-group>
</google-codelab-survey>
<h3 is-upgraded><code>codelab markdown</code></h3>
<pre><code>&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt style=&#34;background-color:#cfe2f3;&#34;&gt;Survey&lt;/dt&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Example item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example item 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 is-upgraded>IMPORTANT!</h3>
<aside class="warning"><p>Unfortunately, the background color value (<code>#cfe2f3</code>) is a <em>magic</em> attribute value.  Without this <em>exact</em> color value, the Survey object will not work as intended.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Download buttons</h2>
<p>You can create a special button to Download something (like a tagged github repo).<br><a href="https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/demo-auc-app/archive/v3.0.zip" target="_blank">Download v3.0</a></p>
<aside class="warning"><p>This currently doesn&#39;t work with the <code>claat</code> tool!  Instead the ‘button&#39; is shown as a download link.</p>
